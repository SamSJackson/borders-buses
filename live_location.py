# This is the information that I want to collect.
# Take from multiple bus services - X62, 51, 67

# Call every 30 seconds from 5am to 10pm. Run for one month as of Monday, the 7th of October.

# Each bus service will produce around 15MB of data over the month, no concerns on storage limits. Insert into SQL database after each request.
